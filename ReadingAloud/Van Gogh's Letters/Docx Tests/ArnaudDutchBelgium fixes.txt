Create a rule that changes:

";" to "." - The program doesn't register the aesthetic pause of semicolons

"--" to "." - The program also does (or rather doesn't) towards double-hyphen pauses.

Addressing title commas to "." - The program doesn't pause for effect with introductions.

"I" (self identifying pronoun) to "Eye" - the Dutch (Belgium) accent pronounces I as "ee"

"is a" to "isa" - I don't like the pause inbetween

when "ou" precedes the second to last ending of a word, particularly the last syllable 

Changing "a" to "ay"

when a word ends with "cate", change it to cait

Change words ending in "ly" to "lee"

Change every "this is" to "this is"
